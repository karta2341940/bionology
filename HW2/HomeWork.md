# Introduction
## The Motivation to Study this three article
At first I have to explan why choose this three article.
In the last assignment the assistant who comment my homework said "	
可挑選有點難度的文章" in the field "文章深度適切".It piss me off when I saw it. And that assignment take me five nights from 8pm to 2am to understand the article and to finish the assignment.So this time I pick this three article maybe it's more difficult than last time.
## E.coli
E.coli ( Escherichia coli ) is the commonest microbe in animal's body.<br>
Besides made human get stomachache, E.coli also bring some contribution for human due to their genome is easy to edit .
## DNA
DNA has been described as the most ultimate infomation storage.It can use four bases ACTG to store so many infomation.And also it is the lightest way to store infomation.<br>
The size of human's DNA is 3.2Gbp, lets convert it into computer unit.

The base unit of DNA is base pair ( bp ) and it is combined by 2 nucleobases.
Computer's base unit is bit but we usually use byte(8bit) as a base storage unit.
There are 2 base in a base pair so we can know 4 bp is equivalent to 1 byte.<br>

$3.2Gbp = 3.2\times10^9bp = 3.2\div4\times 10^9bp =(0.8\times10^9)bytes=(8\times 10^8)bytes$
$Convert\; to \; MB \Rightarrow 8\times 10^8bytes = ( \frac{8\times 10^8}{1024^2}) bytes \Rightarrow 762.939453125MB$

As we can see a human we need 763 MB to store in computer. what's that means?

It means we need the area equivalent to a 1Gb NAND chip (the area of NAND chip we use now is close to $3cm^2$ ) to store a humanrace's DNA.
